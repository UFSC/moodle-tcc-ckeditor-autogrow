Auto Grow
=========

With this plugin, CKEditor will automatically expand and shrink vertically depending on the amount and size of content entered in its editing area.

The following configuration options are available:

* **maximum** and **minimum** editor height after adjustment to content,
* **extra space** to be added between content and editor bottom bar,
* having auto grow happen **on editor startup**

Note: This plugin is designed to work only with the **classic editor**.
